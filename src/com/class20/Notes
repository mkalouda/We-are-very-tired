Recap:
Constructor:
is a special block of code that helps us initialize the instance fields/properties of a class
It is called automatically when we create an object of the class
Rules:
1. while defining, we do not mention the return type, not even void
2. name of the constructor should be same as name of class
this. keyword:
when we have the same name - to show Java what exactly we need to use
this can be used with parenthesis to call the current class constructor.
we use this to avoid code repetition
=============================================================================================
inheritance in java is a mechanism/process that we can use to inhrit properties and methods from another class to
avoid duplication.
