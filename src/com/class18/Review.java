		 * local - any variable declared inside a method, constructor or any block of code like if conditions
		 * 			loops and switches are called local variables
		 * 		advantages - memory efficient 
		 * 		disadvantage - very low accessibility 
		 * 
		 * instance - variables declared inside a class and outside of any method constructor or block of code are 
		 * 			  called instance variable
		 * 		advantages - can be accessed in all of the methods which are not static
		 * 					 can be accessed by creating objects inside the static methods or any other class
		 * 		disadvantage - if not used properly can waste a lot of memory
		 * 
		 * static - an instance variable declared with static keyword is called a static variable 
		 * 		advantage - shared across all the instances
