		 * Types of variables with respect to their scope
		 * 
		 * there are three types of variables in JAVA
		 * 1) local variables
		 * 2) instance variables
		 * 3) static variables
		 * 
		 * local:
		 * -  are the variables which are declared inside a method, constructor or any block of code (Ex. if condition, 
		 *    while loop, for loop,switch statement. anything inside a class that has a "{" and ending "}" or
		 *    inside parenthesis like "(" and ")"
		 *    
		 *    for example
		 *    void print
		 *    String name(){
		 *    String name = "gfgfdgfd"; //local variable
		 *    
		 * Instance:
		 * - are the variables which are declared outside a method, constructor or any block of code (Ex. if condition, 
		 *    while loop, for loop,switch statement. anything inside a class that has a "{" and ending "}" or
		 *    inside parenthesis like "(" and ")"
		 *    can be accessed anywhere inside a class y directly calling them using their names but we can not access them 
		 *    Inside static method but we can access them by creating an object of that class
		 *    
		 * Static:
		 * - any instance variable declared with a static keyword is called a static variable;
 		 *
