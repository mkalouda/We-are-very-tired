Abstraction:
1. Abstraction is one of the main four oops concept
2. Abstractions a process of hiding implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.
    Abstraction helps use focus on what the object does instead of how it does it
3. we can achieve the abstraction by using
        abstract classes
        - Abstract class is a class with abstract keyword that has defined and undefined methods
        Rules:
        1. we can not create the object of abstract class directly
        2. to make a method abstract we use the abstract keyword as not access modifier and we do not provide the
        method body
        3. we can not define an abstract method as private, static, and final
            We can not make an abstract method as private because private methods do not participate in inheritance if
            something is not participating in inheritance how can we provide the implementation for that entity
            interfaces
          Why not static
          We can not make abstract method as static because we can not override static methods while abstract methods
          must be overridden
          Why not final
          because final meant something is complete and abstract means something is incomplete these two keywords
          contradict each other
