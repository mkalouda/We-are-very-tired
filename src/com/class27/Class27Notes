Final Keyword:
    Final is a keyword in java that belongs to non access modifiers.
    We can use final keyword with variables, methods, and classes.

    -With variables:
        When used with variables we can not change the content of that variable.
        but if that variable point to an array or any other object we can change the contents
        of that array or object.

    class A{
    int number;
    String name;

    A(int number,String name){
    this.number=number;
    this.name=name;
    }

    public static void main(String[]aaa{

    A var1=new A (1234,"moe");
    var1=new A (4563, "alex");

    -With Methods:
    Class parent{
    final void printInfo(){
    sout"From Parent"
    }
    }

    class Child extends from Parent{
    @override
    void printInfo(){
    sout"From Child"  //CE can not override a final method
    }
    }

    -Final with class:
    final class ABC{

    void method1{

    }
    no class can extend this class

    4 pillars of OOPS:
    Inheritance
    Polymorphism
    Abstraction***
    Encapsulation

    Abstraction:
        In abstraction the internal details of the methods are hidden and we only expose the signature of the methods
        with the return types.

        Rules:
        1. We can not create the objects of the abstract classes because the abstract
