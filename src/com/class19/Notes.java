    Access Modifiers:
    are keywords that control the access to class members (properties, methods, constructor, inner classes, and interfaces)

    1.private (only accessed in same class)
    2.protected (when we inherit from one class only available to the child)
    3.default "its not a keyword" (can be accessed in the same class and same package)
    4.public (available to complete project)
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Constructor:
    is a special block of code that helps us initialize the fields/properties/variables of a class

    class ABC{

    ABC(){

    }

    }
    Constructors are very similar to methods but without return types
    name of the constructor should be same as our class
    -----------------------------------------------------
    1. if we are in s a separate class or if we are inside a static method
    in the same class we need an object of the class if we want to access the instance
    members(fields, methods)
    2. when we are declaring something the sequence does not matter
    the sequence matters when we are calling something
