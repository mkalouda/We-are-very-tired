Final keyword:
    final keyword in java is used to show that something is complete and dont need any modification

    used with:
    1. Variables to indicate that the value of this variable is final
    2. We can use it with methods to show that method implementation is final and it can not be overridden
    by child classes
    3. With classes so that no class can inherit from that class

    Final with variables
    1. Always try to make your variables as final if possible. (helps reduce the bugs)
    2. Widely used with static keyword

    We can overload it but can NOT override it
