Variables and arrays are not flexible to solve common life problems to overcome this we have collections framework
but collection framework cant be used with primitive types it only support object type

Wrapper classes:
-- are object equivalent of primitive data types that can be used with collections framework and have built in methods
to convert one data type to another
1. Arraylist:
-- insertion order is maintained
-- Arraylist can contain duplicate values
-- we can access the elements using indexes by using the get method
-- if we are using collections framework to access the data most of the time we should be using arraylist
 because arraylists use arrays under the hood, the read access is very fast with arrays
 -- if we require to insert the data in front or in the middle of the arraylist then we should not be using arraylist
 because when an item is inserted in between or in the start all the elements in the arraylist are shifted towards right
 (can be very slow if data is huge)
 -- because the arraylist can modify its size at run time it can be problematic to use loops to perform the add and
 remove operations to overcome this we have iterators in java
