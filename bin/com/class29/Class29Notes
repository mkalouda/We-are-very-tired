Variables:
-- They hold data one value at a time
-- What if we need to store more data we will have to decalre that many variables not feasible

Arrays:
-- Consecutive memory location pointed by a single variable
    Issues
    1. fixed in size once the array is declared we can not change the size
    2. if we declare a bigger array at the start we may be wasting memory
    3. if we declare a smaller array we have to do a lot of work to accommodate entries beyond the size of the array

    To rescue we have collection framework in java

Collection framework:
-- is a collection of classes and interfaces tha can hold objets as a single unit like arrays but with a lot of
flexibility

    Pros:
    1. less code built in methods to solve common problems that we may face
    2. no fixed sizes all the classes in collections framework are flexible, we done need to declare the size upfront
    3. memory efficient

    Cons:
    1. we can not use primitive data types in collections framework  to overcome this issue we have wrapper classes

Wrapper classes:
-- wrapper classes are just object equivalent of primitive types, for all of the primitive types we have
   wrapper classes we can use them in collections framework
