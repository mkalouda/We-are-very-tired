Method Overloading:
    Method overloading is a mechanism through which we can define same method multiple times in the same class but
    with different signature(consist of name of method and its parameters) to write cleaner code.

    Rules:
    To overload a method or a constructor we must have the same name but different number of parameters or different
    sequence of parameters.
    We can overload private, static methods
    We can overload constructors
    We can overload the main method
    We overload methods in the same class
    We can NOT overload a method by changing the return type
    We can NOT overload by just changing the parameters name

Compile Time error:
    1. Compiler-> checks for the syntax error "Semantics"... but not for runtime error or logical error
    2. Java source code is converted to byte code
    3. JVM converts the byte code to machine code and executes it

Method Overriding:
    Is a mechanism in java through which parent and child classes can have the same methods if child class does not
    like the implementation from the parent class, the child class can provide its own implementation and depending upon
    the object type proper method will be called

    Rules:
    1. We can not override private constructors because they do not participate in inheritance
    2. Static methods can not be overridden but we can re-declare them
    3. To override we should have an inheritance relationship
    4. The return type name and parameters of the method should be same
    5. We can not decrease the visibility but we can increase it
