Collections Framework:
-- collection of classes and interfaces that can store and manipulate data using different built in data structures
like arrays linkedLists and sets.

Wrapper class:
-- are object equivalent of primitive types
-- collections can not work with primitive data types, they can only work with objects
-- wrapper class provide built in methods to concert the data types and some useful Constant

ArrayList:
-- it implements the list interface
    1. it can hold duplicate values not issues
    2. insertion order is maintained
    3. dynamic in nature can adjust the size at run time automatically
    4. underlying data structure is arrays

Methods in ArrayList class:
-- add() = adds the element in natural sequence
-- add() = we can specify the index
-- get(int index) = return the element specified index
-- remove(int index) = removes the elements at specified index
-- remove(object) = object will be removed

LinkedList:
-- it can hold duplicate values not issues
-- insertion order is maintained
-- dynamic in nature can adjust the size at run time automatically
-- underlying data structure is doubly LinkedList

Sets:
-- is an interface, we know three classes which implement Set interface
    1. Hashset (most widely used)
        -- no duplicates
        -- no order, since internally they use Hash function
        -- use when fast search is required
        -- allows null value
    2. LinkedHashset
        -- no duplicates
        -- insertion order is maintained
        -- allows null value
    3. TreeSet
        -- no duplicates
        -- all the elements are sorted in natural order
