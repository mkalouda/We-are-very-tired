Map:
-- Map is a data structure (A way to store ans manipulate data) that stores the data in the form of keys and values.
-- keys and values must be object
-- indexes can be any type of objects, index is just a way of accessing the data from your data structure
-- maps can have any type of object as their indexes
-- keys can not be duplicated
-- values can be duplicated

    When to use maps:
    1. fast search because underlying data structure is a hash function that stores the data in form of nodes
    2. when we want the indexes other than natural indexes like integers

    Types of Maps:
    1. HashMap(order is not maintained, fastest) not thread safe
    2. LinkedHashMap (order is maintained, slower than hashmap)
    3. TreeMap (it always store the data in numerical way)
    4. HashTable (similar to hashmap, it should be used when we have to write multithreaded code
        because it is thread safe)
