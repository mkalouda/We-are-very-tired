Methods:
Method is a block of code that performs some action and it may or may not return anything.

Method definition:
-Access Modifiers : could be public, private, protected, Default
1. public methods are accessible anywhere in the project
 public static void  method1(){

    }


Most widely used access modifiers are public and private
always use public if you want to expose some functionalities of your classes to other classes
private should be used when the functionality is only supposed to be used within the same class

static: we can call this method without creating an object of the class

Return Type:
void-> returns nothing
can return anything by calling it

name:
()-> if we are not getting anything from outside we leave it empty
(ex. int number)-> if we are taking any input we mention it in the parenthesis

{} = body of the method

Types of variables in java by scope:
There are three types of variables in by scope in java
1. local
any variable declared in side any block of code (method constructor, loops, switch etc.)
benefits: occupies the memory for short amount of time once the block is executed, memory is free to be utilized
issue: limited scope can only be accessed inside that specific block

2. instance
any variable declared inside a class but outside a block of code
benefits: access anywhere in the class
issue: keep occupying the memory as far the object stays in the memory, should be avoided

3.static
are shared across all the instances of a class, they belong to class and can be accessed by writing the
name of the class
