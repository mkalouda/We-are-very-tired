SuperKeyword:
    We can use super keyword to access constructors or methods or fields from parent class in child class

    When it makes sense to use super keyword
    - if we have the same name fields and methods in the parent and child classes then we can use the super keyword
    with the "this" keyword to distinguish between the fields of child and parent class

    Most widely use of super
    -super is widely used to call the constructor from the parent class

Method Overloading:
    Overloading is a mechanism in java where same method or constructor can exist with different within a class

    uses:
    cleaner code
    We do not need to come up with a new name every time if a method is doing the same thing but with different
    parameters

    We can overload our methods
        1. changing the number of parameters
        2. changing the type of parameters
        3. by changing the sequence of parameters

    We call it static binding, compile time polymorphism, and early binding
====================================================================================================
Method Overriding:
    A mechanism through which parent and child classes can have the same methods
    If child class does not like the implementation from the parent class

        1. We can not override private methods and constructors because they dont participate in inheritance and
            not available in child classes
        2. We can not decrease the visibility because it breaks the inheritance contract
        3. Static methods can not be overriden they belong to class not object we can hide/re declare them
        4. Methods must have the same signature and return type
        5. final methods can not be overriden
        6. subclass in different package can only override methods that are public or protected

    it is also called dynamic binding, late binding, runtime polymorphism
====================================================================================================
Final Keyword:
    is a non access modifier that used when we have to say something is complete and dont need modification
    When used with class no other class can inherit it
    When used with variables we can not change the value of that variable
    When used with methods those methods can not be overridden
